  <h1>Spiderman â€¢ web crawler</h1>
</div>

Spiderman is a Ruby gem for crawling and processing web pages.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spiderman'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spiderman

## Usage

```ruby
class HackerNewsCrawler
 include Spiderman

 crawl "https://news.ycombinator.com/" do |response|
   response.css('a.storylink').each do |a|
     process! a["href"], :story
   end
 end

 process :story do |response|
   logging.info "#{response.uri} #{response.css('title').text}"
   save_page(response)
 end

 def save_page(page)
   # logic here for saving the page
 end
end
```

Run the crawler:

```ruby
HackerNewsCrawler.crawl!
```

### ActiveJob

Spiderman works with [ActiveJob](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html) out of the box. If your crawler class inherits from `ActiveJob:Base`, then requests will be made in your background worker. Each request will run as a separate job.

```ruby
class MyCrawer < ActiveJob::Base
  queue_as :crawler

  crawl "https://example.com" do |response|
    response.css('a').each {|a| process! a["href"], :link }
  end

  process :link do |response|
    logger.info "Processing #{response.uri}"
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
